** Install using included scripts

You can use the install/uninstall scripts to install/uninstall the program on every distro

	INSTALL:

Untar the tarball and run as root the install.sh script . I strongly recommend NOT to install this
application via this way. Please use the package for your distro ( listed above ). Otherwise you
can untar is on a folder on your $HOME and launch it from there without installation

On the folder where you had untared the program run the uninstall.sh script 

Please delete on your own the folder ~/.pysmssend
