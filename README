ACCOUNT MANAGER:

Account manager is a new feature introduced on version 1.28.

The main purpose of it is to help you store some predifined accounts for multiple user situations. Each account requires a custom name.
So the only thing you have to do is to select a custom name of the account, select the account, write the username and password and save it. After that the new account will appear on the left and you can select it from there or from the first tab from the drop down menu
